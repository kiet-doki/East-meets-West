# East-meets-West

The East meets West Passion Project aims to assist international students in adapting to overseas life by leveraging machine learning algorithms to match prospective students with current ones. This project is designed to help new students better integrate into their new environment, fostering a supportive community and easing the transition process. By connecting students with similar backgrounds, interests, and experiences, I aim to create a platform that promotes cultural exchange, friendship, and mutual support.
